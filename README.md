# Mining
The main function of this code is:

ðŸ§  To build a machine learning model using logistic regression that can predict whether an object detected by sonar is a mine or a rock, based on its signal readings.
ðŸ’¡ What It Does in Simple Terms:
Loads sonar data (each sample has 60 features from sonar signal).

Trains a logistic regression model to learn the difference between rocks and mines.

Evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy on both training and test datasets.

Uses the model to predict whether a new sonar signal is a mine or a rock.

ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Use Case:
This kind of system could be used by a submarine or underwater robot to:

Automatically analyze sonar signals

Decide whether an object is a dangerous underwater mine or just a harmless rock
